Add icons from popular icon libraries into your leptos projects. Every icon is packaged as its own cargo feature to reduce build times.

Currently, you can use this [example](/examples/simple-app) as a guide, but better examples and docs are coming. An [index site](https://carlosted.github.io/icondata/) is also available if you wish to filter through available icons.
