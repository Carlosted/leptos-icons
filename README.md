Add icons from popular icon libraries into your leptos projects. Every icon is packaged as its own cargo feature to reduce build times.

Please note that until version 0.1.0 is published, any patch update can be a breaking change and is not guaranteed to work.

Currently, you can use this [example](/examples/simple-app) as a guide, but better examples and docs are coming. An [index site](https://carlosted.github.io/icondata/) is also available if you wish to filter through available icons.
