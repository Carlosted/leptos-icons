# Build

This crate is the **generator** of the `leptos-icons` library living alongside this crate.

## Usage

Once inside this directory, trigger a build with

    cargo run

This will use the downloaded icon packages from the previous run, updating them when necessary, and generate the `leptos-icons` library crate along with individual icon crates (i.e. `leptos-icons-*`).

Note that this is the default as this may greatly reduces the runtime of this crate.

If you want to run a clean build, removing previously downloaded content, preferred when generating a new release, use

    cargo run -- --clean

This is the only possible argument right now. You can always check for other arguments with

    cargo run -- --help

## Notes

Each crate is not generated completely from scratch. The following files and directories are touched within each crate.

| ---        | ---      |
| src/\*     | Replaced |
| Cargo.toml | Replaced |
