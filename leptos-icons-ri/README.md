- This crate is **heavily** inspired by the [solidjs-icons](https://github.com/x64Bits/solid-icons) library.

## Usage

To use this crate, it is currently required to use Git linking, as it is not yet published to crates.io.
Use icons by specifying their feature names. For example `BsFolder` for the Bootstrap-Icons `Folder` icon.

```toml
[dependencies]
# ...
leptos-icons = { git = "https://github.com/Carlosted/leptos-icons.git" features = ["BsFolder"] }
```

## Icon Packages

Licenses of the icons provided through these libraries were extracted with best intent,
but must only be taken as a hint. Please check the individual icon repositories for up-to-date license information.
